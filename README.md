# Simple First Person Game template

A really simple first person game template, that contains extremely basic stuff.

This template supports:
- Basic movement (crouching, running, walking, looking with your mouse, etc)
- Interactions
- Basic pause menu
- that's it

This template contains all of the basic stuff you'd want for a first person game (probably)

If you want to use this template, delete the test scene node, and the test scene assets. They are not nessesary for this template to work. Why would you keep them in anyway?

Read the internal documentation (that "Search Help" button on your script IDE window thing) or the scripts themselves for more information.
